Machine Learning Algorithms: Polynomial Regression
This repository contains an implementation of the Polynomial Regression algorithm as part of my machine learning studies. It includes simple Polynomial regression model, along with code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. The project serves as a foundational step in understanding and applying supervised learning techniques.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute!
